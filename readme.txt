--Readme document for Alex Le, alexml4@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment


2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    A basic features in the website is the resume button that allows the user to click on the button on the home section of the website or the navigation bar and it will take them to a new link within the browser of a pdf of my resume. 
    Another basic feature added was the logos in the footers that allows the user to quickly view my social media pages such as Instagram, GitHub, and/or LinkedIn by clicking on it which is a link to the appropiate page.
    Another feature is the images throughout the website that allows the website to be more visually appealing such as the logos for the skills section and portrait so the user can get to know me more.

(b) CSS features
    Bootstrap was used to help the webpage be more visually appealing using containers, rows, and columns. The layout of the screen changes as the dimensions change.
    The lexend font from Google was utilized to make the website have a smoother and comfortable look to it. With sans serif being the fallback font if the lexend font has problems appearing on the website.
    The header and footer both have different colors from the main part of the page to create the constrat and look better in terms of dividing the content.
    Padding and margins were changed to help create spacing between elements to create less of a cluttered appearance.

(c) Advanced features
    An advance feature that I included in my portfolio was the navigation bar at the top of the page. The navbar allows the user to click on the section there are interested in and it will scroll the page automatically to that section. In addition, it is also a sticky navigation bar meaning it is accessible at all times when viewing the page on a laptop. The navbar disappears in smaller screens so that website can still be visually appealling at a small screen dimension.


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
    I ignored the potential problems in the accessibility checker. A lot of the accessibility concerns was with the alt text and how it may not be appropiate for the image but it isn't a concern because I properly addressed decorative images with no alt text and those that have meaning with proper descriptions.
    Another potential problem group has to do with the layout of the screen. I don't think it is a concern because when using Chrome Developer Tools, the website is still useable and responds to the different screen dimensions and doesn't cause issues.
    Lastly, the rest of the potnetial problems do more in depth with link text and titles not being meaningful but I don't think that is right because it the texts allow the user to know the meaning of the website and the links they are clicking on.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    It took around 10 hours to complete this assignment.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/
    These resources helped me develop parts of the website that I wanted to implement in the website that either lecture didn't cover or I didn't quite understand the topic enough in.


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    I didn't consult with anyone else with this assignment.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    No.
